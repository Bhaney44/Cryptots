# Algorand Autonomous 
Our project introduces Algorand Autonomous, a smart contract platform, voting mechanism, and a full-stack DAO deployment mechanism. Autonomous Algorand, centers around creating a self-updating DAO using smart contracts on the Algorand blockchain and a neural network to reduce both volatility and risk for investors. At the technical cconvergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence, Algorand Autonomous is a platform for technical and financial innovation.

# Problem
Across blockchain networks, governance is a complex task with multiple stakeholders having several financial interests. The process by which decisions are made among these stakeholders is often centralized with certain authorities. For example, investment funds typically are controlled by a central authority. However, this decision-making framework limits openness for global community development and collaboration, as well as the personal autonomy of network participants.

# Solution
The solution is a self-updating Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with three parts.  First, a smart contract platform is made available to DAO users. This contract software solves the payment processing problem by making smart contracts simpler and more accessible to new developers and general users. Second, a consensus voting mechanism is established to govern the DAO by democratic process. The consensus voting mechanism will allow the code to evolve to the will of the network. For example, The staking mechanism may evolve using Algorand Standard Asset (ASA) voting. 

Third, the smart contract platform and voting procedure are deployed through an online interface and DAO platform. We seek to ensure that all transactions and financial data can be uploaded readily by the user to Skynet. This will enable users to have a secure way to view their financial information and have it be stored remotely. As such, we can provide investors with a decentralized method to invest in both securities and cryptocurrencies. Our goal is to enable users to retain the security that comes with pooling while having independence. Our competitive advantage is AlogNet, a neural network for predicting price changes in Algo.
