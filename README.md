# Autonomous Algorand
Cryptots is a team working on a project for entry in the MIT Bitcoin Expo Hackathon. The project, Autonomous Algorand, centers around creating a DAO using smart contracts on the Algorand blockchain.

# Problem
Across blockchain networks, governance is a complex task with multiple stakeholders having several financial interests. The process by which decisions are made among these stakeholders is often centralized with certain authorities. For example, investment funds typically are controlled by a central authority. However, this decision-making framework limits openness for global community development and collaboration, as well as the personal autonomy of network participants.

# Solution
The solution is a self-updating Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with three parts. First, a smart contract platform is made available to DAO users. Second, a consensus voting mechanism is established to govern the DAO by democratic process. Third, the smart contract platform and voting procedure are deployed through an online interface and DAO platform.
